# Hooks
Think of hooks as events â€“ they're what you code on. They serve as the starting point for your codes.\

# programs.scl Hook
These are the hooks inside of the file called `programs.scl`.
## Function Chunks
These chunks get called during the transition of the game.\
You can use these files to create your own functions and shorten exisiting functions by simply removing the original code or trimming it.
> [!WARNING]
> You cannot code in these chunks, you can only define variables or create functions in these chunks.
